Team: Heapster App: Recipix

Overview Allow users to add ingredients from their fridge and get recipes based on those ingredients.

MVP Recipix is an app that recommends recipes based on items that are in your fridge, giving priority to the ones that are about to expire. It’ll let you manually add items or scan them using their bar code, as well as the expiration date. It will also recommend recipes based on your preferences or food restrictions you may have.

The front end will be done with React Native and Expo for development purposes. We are also going to be using Redux to handle our actions and reducer, and for the backend we plan on using Express.

Technologies • Expo BarCodeScanner – used to scan barcodes • React Native – used to develop mobile applications • Redux – state management • Edamam – product • spoonacular - recipe lookup

Future Features: • Recommendation Engine • Auto complete for recipes • Upload own recipes and photos of dish • Push notifications that informs users of ingredients that are about to expire • Shows users missing ingredients for selected recipes • Image recognition when adding items • Allows users to see friends’ recommended recipes • Allows users to combine ingredients with friends’ fridge to generate a list of recipes they can cook together
